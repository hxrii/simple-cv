# simple-cv

Created a Simple portfolio landing page using basic HTML and CSS. This is in accordance with Web Developemt Bootcamp by Angela Yu, which I'm finding very useful as of now. 
May update or leave this project in this state later.

Note: Wb Page is not responsive as it is build on basic HTML and CSS. Hence in mobile view, the webpage sucks
